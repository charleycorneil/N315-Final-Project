### Overview

This project is a replication of the Keurig coffee makers page. The purpose of this project is:

1. It is my final project for a N315, using my skills in creating a responsive, functional, and visually appealing website.
2. It reflects my personal interest in exploring coffee makers as I’m currently in the market for a new one.
3. It allows me to practice building an e-commerce website, which is a vital skill for my career aspirations in web design and development.

### Site Navigation and Structure

#### 1. **Homepage Header**

The homepage begins with a header section featuring the Keurig logo, a navigation bar, and a search bar. In the top right corner there is a link for support, to create an account and to view/add things to a cart. The navigation bar includes links to other sections of the Keurig website, such as coffee, accessories, and customer support. This ensures intuitive navigation for users.

#### 2. **Hero Banner**

Below the header, a large hero banner showcases promotional content. This banner is dynamic and visually captivating, highlighting Cyber Monday deals.

#### 3. **Product Grid Section**

The main body of the page contains a product grid, presenting a selection of Keurig coffee makers. Each product card includes an image, name, price, and a brief description. Users can click on a product to view more details, mimicking the idea of real-world e-commerce functionality. The product grid is designed to be fully responsive, ensuring a easy user experience across devices.

#### 4. **Filter and Sort Tools**

To enhance usability, the site includes filter and sort tools on the left-hand side. Users can refine their search by price, features, or brewing capacity, making it easy to find a coffee maker that suits their needs. This replicates a standard feature in e-commerce sites.

#### 5. **Footer**

The footer section includes useful links to FAQs, shipping information, and customer support. Social media icons allow users to connect with the brand on various platforms. This section ensures users can access essential information easily. In the very bottom contains the copyright information.

### Purpose of the Project

2. **Personal Interest:** If I were in the market for a new coffee maker, this project would allow me to combine my personal interest with a practical application. Building this site deepened my understanding of the features and specifications of Keurig products.

3. **Skill Development:** Creating an e-commerce site is an effective way to practice skills that are vital to a career in web design and development. This project provided hands-on experience in designing user-friendly interfaces, implementing product filtering, and ensuring cross-device responsiveness.
